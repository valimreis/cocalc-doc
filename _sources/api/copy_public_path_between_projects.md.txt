* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``src_project_id``: id of source project (required)
* ``src_path``: relative path of directory or file in the source project (required)
* ``target_project_id``: id of target project (required)
* ``target_path``: defaults to src_path
* ``overwrite_newer``: overwrite newer versions of file at destination (destructive) (default: false)
* ``delete_missing``: delete files in dest that are missing from source (destructive) (default: false)
* ``backup``: make ~ backup files instead of overwriting changed files (default: false)
* ``timeout``: how long to wait for the copy to complete before reporting error (though it could still succeed)
* ``exclude_history``: if true, exclude all files of the form `*.sage-history` (default: false)

Copy a file or directory from a public project to a target project.

**Note:** the `timeout` option is passed to a call to the `rsync` command.
If no data is transferred for the specified number of seconds, then
the copy terminates. The default is 0, which means no timeout.

**Note:** You need to have write access to the target project.

Example:

Copy public file `PUBLIC/doc.txt` from source project to private file
`A/sample.txt` in target project.

```
