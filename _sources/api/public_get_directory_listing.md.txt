# public_get_directory_listing

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``project_id``: id of project containing public file to be read (required)
* ``path``: path of directory in target project (required)
* ``hidden``: show hidden files (default: false)
* ``time``: sort by timestamp, with newest first (default: false)
* ``start``:  (default: 0)
* ``limit``:  (default: -1)

Given a project id and relative path (i.e. not beginning with a slash),
list all public files and subdirectories under that path.
Path is required, but may be the empty string, in which case
a public listing of the home directory in the target project is
returned.

Examples:

Get public directory listing. Directory "Public" is shared and
contains one file "hello.txt" and one subdirectory "p2".

Security key may be blank.

```
  curl -u : \
    -d path=Public \
    -d project_id=9a19cca3-c53d-4c7c-8c0f-e166aada7bb6 \

  ==> {"event":"public_directory_listing",
       "id":"3e576b3b-b673-4d5c-9bce-780883f92958",
       "result":{"files":[{"size":41,"name":"hello.txt","mtime":1496430932},
                          {"isdir":true,"name":"p2","mtime":1496461616}]}
