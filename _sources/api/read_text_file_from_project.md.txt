# read_text_file_from_project

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``project_id``: id of project containing file to be read (or array of project_id's) (required)
* ``path``: path to file to be read in target project (or array of paths) (required)

Read a text file in the project whose `project_id` is supplied.

Argument `'path'` is relative to home directory in target project.

You can also read multiple `project_id`/`path`'s at once by
making `project_id` and `path` arrays (of the same length).
In that case, the result will be an array
of `{project_id, path, content}` objects, in some random order.
If there is an error reading a particular file,
instead `{project_id, path, error}` is included.

**Note:** You need to have read access to the project,
the Linux user `user` in the target project must have permissions to read the file
and containing directories.

Example:

Read a text file.
```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d project_id=e49e86aa-192f-410b-8269-4b89fd934fba \
    -d path=Assignments/A1/h1.txt \

       "id":"481d6055-5609-450f-a229-480e518b2f84",
       "content":"hello"}
```
