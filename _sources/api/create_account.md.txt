# create_account

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``password``: if given, must be between 6 and 64 characters in length
* ``agreed_to_terms``: must be true or user will get nagged
* ``token``: account creation token - see src/dev/docker/README.md
* ``get_api_key``: if set to anything truth-ish, will create (if needed) and return api key with signed_in message
* ``usage_intent``: response to Cocalc usage intent at sign up

Examples:

Create a new account:
```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d first_name=John00 \
    -d last_name=Doe00 \
    -d email_address=jd@example.com \
    -d password=xyzabc09090 \
    -d agreed_to_terms=true https://cocalc.com/api/v1/create_account
```

Option `agreed_to_terms` must be present and specified as true.
Account creation fails if there is already an account using the
given email address, if `email_address` is improperly formatted,
and if password is fewer than 6 or more than 64 characters.

Attempting to create the same account a second time results in an error:
```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d first_name=John00 \
    -d last_name=Doe00 \
    -d email_address=jd@example.com \
    -d password=xyzabc09090 \
    -d agreed_to_terms=true https://cocalc.com/api/v1/create_account
  ==> {"event":"account_creation_failed",
       "id":"2332be03-aa7d-49a6-933a-cd9824b7331a",
       "reason":{"email_address":"This e-mail address is already taken."}}
```
