# copy_path_status

* ``copy_path_id``: A unique UUID for a copy path operation
* ``src_project_id``: Source of copy operation to filter on
* ``target_project_id``: Target of copy operation to filter on
* ``src_path``: (src/targ only) Source path of copy operation to filter on
* ``limit``: (src/targ only) maximum number of results  (max 1000) (default: 1000)
* ``offset``: (src/targ only) default 0; set this to a multiple of the limit
* ``pending``: (src/targ only) true returns copy ops, which did not finish yet (default: true) (default: true)
* ``failed``: (src/targ only) if true, only show finished and failed copy ops (default: false) (default: false)

Retrieve status information about copy path operation(s).

There are two ways to query:

- **single result** for a specific `copy_path_id`,
  which was returned by `copy_path_between_projects` earlier;
- **array of results**, for at last one of `src_project_id` or `target_project_id`,
  and additionally filtered by an optionally given `src_path`.

Check for the field `"finished"`, containing the timestamp when the operation completed.
There might also be an `"error"`!

**Note:** You need to have read/write access to the associated src/target project.
