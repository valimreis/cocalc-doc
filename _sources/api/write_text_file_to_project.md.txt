# write_text_file_to_project

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``project_id``: id of project where file is created (required)
* ``path``: path to file, relative to home directory in destination project (required)
* ``content``: contents of the text file to be written (required)

Create a text file in the target project with the given `project_id`.
Directories containing the file are created if they do not exist already.
If a file already exists at the destination path, it is overwritten.

**Note:** You need to have read access to the project.
The Linux user `user` in the target project must have permissions to create files
and containing directories if they do not already exist.

Example:

Create a text file.
```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d project_id=e49e86aa-192f-410b-8269-4b89fd934fba \
    -d "content=hello$'\n'world" \
    -d path=Assignments/A1/h1.txt \
