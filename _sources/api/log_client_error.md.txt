# log_client_error

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``error``: error string (required)

Log an error so that CoCalc support can look at it.

In the following example, an explicit message id
is provided for future reference.
```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d id=34a424dc-1731-4b31-ba3d-fc8a484980d9 \
    -d "error=cannot load library xyz" \
    https://cocalc.com/api/v1/log_client_error
  ==> {"event":"success",
       "id":"34a424dc-1731-4b31-ba3d-fc8a484980d9"}
```

Note: the above API call will create the following record in the
`client_error_log` database table. This table is not readable
via the API and is intended for use by CoCalc support only:
```
[{"id":"34a424dc-1731-4b31-ba3d-fc8a484980d9",
  "event":"error",
  "error":"cannot load library xyz",
  "account_id":"1c87a139-9e13-4cdd-b02c-e7d41dcfe921",
  "time":"2017-07-06T02:32:41.176Z"}]
```
