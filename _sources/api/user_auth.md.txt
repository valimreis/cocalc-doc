* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``account_id``: account_id for account to get an auth token for (required)
* ``password``: password for account to get token for (required)

.. index:: pair: Token; Authentication
Example:

Obtain a temporary authentication token for an account, which
is a 24 character string. Tokens last for **12 hours**.  You can
only obtain an auth token for accounts that have a password.

```
  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \
    -d account_id=99ebde5c-58f8-4e29-b6e4-b55b8fd71a1b \
    -d password=secret_password \

  ==> {"event":"user_auth_token","id":"9e8b68ac-08e8-432a-a853-398042fae8c9","auth_token":"BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2"}
```

You can now use the auth token to craft a URL like this:

    https://cocalc.com/app?auth_token=BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2

and provide that to a user.  When they visit that URL, they will be temporarily signed in as that user.
