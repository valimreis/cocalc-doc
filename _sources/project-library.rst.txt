Project Library
================

The *Library* is a collection of material, which you can copy into your project.
You open up the dialog, explore and select an interesting element,
and then click the ``Get a Copy`` button.
This copies over the snapshot of files hosted on CoCalc into the current directory of your project.

In "Introduction" it contains a couple of documents to learn more about CoCalc.
You can explore its capabilities by opening the respective files.
More advanced topics are covered in "Mathematics", "Physics", "Statistics" and "Data science".
There are also collections of :doc:`LaTeX <latex>` templates.

The screenshot below outlines the steps to
open the library (1);
select a specific entry (2), and (3);
and then copy over the files (4).
