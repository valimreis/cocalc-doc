Trial Projects
================================

When you start using CoCalc, you will see a banner similar to

    "Trial Project â€“ buy upgrades or expect poor performance, [...] you can't install software packages [...]"

That's because there are no upgrades for :doc:`hosting and/or internet access <billing>` applied to this project.

.. warning::

    CoCalc costs us significant money to run.
    CoCalc receives no funding from charitable foundations and
    the site depends entirely on your financial support to continue operating.
    Without your financial support this service will not survive long-term!

Trial projects do not expire, but please be aware that without compensation for development and hosting,
CoCalc itself will not be around indefinitely.

**To remove the warning message** from the top of your project, *at least one collaborator must upgrade the project to run on members-only hosting and have network access*.

.. note::

    **CoCalc will never charge you**, except after you explicitly purchase a subscription or course package.


Ways to remove the banner
===============================


Purchase upgrades
--------------------------------------------

Starting with a \$14/month standard subscription,
you get quotas to :doc:`upgrade four projects, unlock internet access, etc <billing>`.

The `pricing page <https://cocalc.com/policies/pricing.html>`_ lists the current offerings.


.. note::

    You have to explicitly apply your upgrades to your projects.
    Open up *Project Settings* and click *Adjust your upgrade contributions...*
    in the *Project usage and quotas* panel.
    For more information read the :doc:`upgrade guide <upgrade-guide>`.


You can easily change which projects you have upgraded at any time.
Thank you for being a customer!


Student in a course
--------------------------------------------

Ask your teacher/instructor to buy a :ref:`course package and distribute the upgrades <course-upgrading-students>` to the student projects (which should include yours).
If it is just for a short project or a small course, they might as well want to get a "personal" subscription,
which can also be used to upgrade your student project!

Alternatively, if you're a student in a course, ask your instructor to enable the "Students pay" option in course settings,
which makes available a special one-time \$14 fee for a four month subscription to you.

In both cases, we are available to talk to the teacher/instructor directly and explain CoCalcs course functionality.
For inquiries, contact us at `help@sagemath.com <help@sagemath.com>`_.

**For more details, read the** :ref:`course-upgrading-students` **section in the teaching guide.**


Via a project collaborator
--------------------------------------------

If one of your colleagues/friends has upgrades to share, add her/him to your the project as a collaborator.
The can apply their upgrades to your project!

All users of the project benefit fully of the upgrade applied by one collaborator.



Disable banner (paying customers)
--------------------------------------------

Alternatively,  once you are a paying customer, you'll find a new checkbox in Account Preferences that's lets you hide the warning banner for yourself when using a free trial project:

    [x] Hide free warnings: do not show a warning banner when using a free trial project (thanks for being a customer)



Can't afford to purchase upgrades
---------------------------------------

**You may continue using your project for free, despite the warning message.** However, please keep in mind that (1) you can't pull in external data from the internet to the project, (2) the project will get randomly restarted and runs on servers with lower hosting quality, and (3) CoCalc itself **really needs your support in order to survive**.




Reasons for purchasing a subscription
==============================================



The **Purpose of CoCalc** is to make it easy to use SageMath
(and other open-source software like Python, R, Octave, Julia,  LaTeX, etc.),
collaboratively and to generate a stable revenue source to hire full-time developers to develop CoCalc and ultimately SageMath.


.. warning::

    Subscription revenue is currently enough to pay for server infrastructure but **not** enough to cover employee costs.
    This means the company behind CoCalc will eventually no longer be able to operate the service.
    See http://wstein.org/talks/2016-06-sage-bp/bp.pdf for more info about the challenges of funding SageMath development.

.. index:: pair: Trial Projects; Internet Access

Internet Access
---------------------

The Internet Access upgrade allows outgoing internet connections and outbound email from a project.
See :ref:`Internet Access <internet-access>` for details.

.. index:: pair: Trial Projects; Member Hosting

Member Hosting
---------------------

Servers hosting trial projects have fewer compute resources and a higher project load than members-only servers.
See :ref:`Member Hosting <member-hosting>` for details.

Better support
---------------------

Subscribers get higher priority on feature-requests and much more involved support responses.

More resources
---------------------
You can purchase additional compute, memory, and storage resources. (see :doc:`upgrade-guide`)


Upgrades can be shared
-------------------------

You can share your upgrades with friends, co-workers and family.


Fund improvement of CoCalc
-----------------------------

Improvements are made daily!
You can follow CoCalc's development at https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/


Support those who cannot afford to pay
------------------------------------------

When you get a paid subscription, or donate, you help fund the free-tier offering for those who can't afford a subscription. We all know of some countries (and plenty of individuals in every country) that are going through extremely difficult financial times.


Funding SageMath development
------------------------------

A long-term goal is to generate enough revenue to fund development of SageMath.
However, that goal is far away.
Read about `directly funding SageMath <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/wiki/sagemath-funding>`_.
