Upgrade the Teaching Project First!
###################################

If you're using CoCalc course management, we *strongly recommend* that the project containing the ``.course`` file have upgrades for Member Hosting and Internet Access. These upgrades are available with any level of subscription to CoCalc. Some functionality that involves inviting students via email, notifications, etc., will only work with the Internet Access upgrade. We also pride ourselves on offering extensive support to paying customers. If you're an instructor and need a free trial subscription, do not hesitate to contact us at help@cocalc.com.
