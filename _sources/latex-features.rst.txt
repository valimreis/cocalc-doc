LaTeX editor features

LaTeX Multi-File Support
------------------------------

CoCalc's support for multi-file documents is now available. Here's a summary of features:

* The user interface is initially identical to the current single-file interface.
* If you explicitly input other files, then build, there is a new menu on the top of a text editor that lets you select from any of the subfiles.
* If you double click on the pdf on some latex generated by a subfile, then that file is automatically opened.
* Errors and warnings have links that, when clicked, may open a subfile.
* Forward search from subfiles works as it should.
* Saving a subfile saves all files and kicks off a build.

See the section `LaTeX/Modular Documents <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents>`_ in the WikiBooks LaTeX book for a helpful introduction to working with multiple files in LaTeX.

.. _latex-forward-inverse:

Forward & Inverse Search
------------------------------

Forward and inverse search are extremely helpful for navigating in a larger document.

**Forward**: place your cursor at a specific location in the editor on the left-hand side.
Click the "Forward" button or the ``[ALT] + [Return]`` keyboard shortcut to jump to the corresponding
location in the PDF preview.
(In rare cases where full positional information is not available, this feature may not be active.)

**Inverse**: Double-click on an area of interest in the **PDF Preview** area.
The cursor in the text editor will jump to the paragraph in the source-code.

.. _latex-spellcheck:
.. index:: LaTeX Editor; spellcheck

Spellcheck
------------------

Spell checking during LaTeX editing is available for several languages. You can enable/disable Spellcheck and change the language *for a particular file* by opening the ``Settings`` frame as shown:

    :align: center
    
You can use your browser's spell checking for the document if you prefer. Choose "Browser (your browser's spell check)". You can find out more about browser spell checking
`here <https://support.luminello.com/article/1090-how-does-spell-checker-work-in-each-browser>`_.
In many browsers, a misspelled word is indicated by a colored underline, and control-clicking the underlined word will bring up a menu of suggested spellings.

Note that the Spellcheck feature is also available in Markdown and HTML editors.

.. _latex-word-count:

Word count
------------------

CoCalc can show you current word count statistics generated by texcount_.
In order to see them, change one of the frames or created a new one in the :doc:`Frame editor <frame-editor>`.
Select **"Word Count"** as shown below:

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; build engine
.. _latex-build-engine:

LaTeX Engines
----------------------

* **latexmk** + **PDFlatex**: the default configuration, works in most cases
* **latexmk** + **XeLaTeX**: this is useful for foreign languages with many special characters.
* **latexmk** + **LuaTex**: uses the `LuaLaTeX`_ engine.

.. _LuaLaTeX: http://www.luatex.org

Encoding
------------------------

**UTF8**: the build process runs in a Linux environment.
All edited documents are assumed to be encoded as UTF-8.
Therefore, depending if you compile via PDFLaTeX or XeLaTeX, the following encoding definitions are the preferred choices:

* PDFLaTeX::

   \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
   \usepackage{lmodern}

* XeLaTeX or LuaTeX::

   \usepackage{fontspec}


The default template already selects the correct configuration for you.
