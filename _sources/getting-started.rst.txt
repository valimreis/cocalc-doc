Signing in
----------

Once you have signed in for the first time,
sign-in in will be automatic if you are using
the same browser and computer.
All you will
generally need to do is point your browser
to https://cocalc.com.

You will need to sign in again if you
    * connect from a different browser or computer
    * clear your browser cookies.
    * sign out


Creating a Project
------------------

Now that you are signed in, create your first project.
Click in the **Project title** area and enter a project name, for example
"My Project", and then click **Create Project**.

Creating a File
---------------

Once you have opened a project, you are ready to create a file.

If your project isn't upgraded, you will get a red banner warning that your
project is running on a trial server. Ignore the warning for now and keep going.

Click **(+) New** and enter **example** where it says,
**Name your file...**.
and click **Jupyter notebook** to select the file type.
Clicking a button for the type of file causes
the file extension is added automatically.

Running a Jupyter Notebook
--------------------------

We're going to run a simple Python program, so let's change
the kernel from **SageMath (stable)** to **Python 3 (Anaconda 5)**.
In the image, arrow 1 points to the place where the current kernel is displayed,
while arrows 2 and 3 indicate how to select the new Jupyter kernel.

Now enter a line of python code in the first cell of the notebook:

The Project Toolbar
-------------------

Here's quick tour of the topmost toolbar in CoCalc, the **Project Toolbar**.

.. image:: img/getting-started/toolbars-projects-a.png
     :width: 90% 

Going from left to right:

.. index:: Project Toolbar; projects button

* |cocalc-logo| **Projects button** - click here to create a new project and see a list of your existing projects. Any text you type into the **Search for Projects** field will be used to select which projects are displayed. Any project with matching text in Title or Description will appear in the filtered list. If you have any hidden or deleted projects, a checkbox will appear to allow you to show those.

.. index:: Project Toolbar; open projects

* **Open projects** - a tab button will appear for each project you have open.

.. index:: Project Toolbar; about CoCalc

* |info-circle| **CoCalc** - Information about CoCalc. Includes links to tutorials, examples, lists of available languages, libraries, and packages, and real-time stats for the platform.

.. index::
   Support; create support request
   seealso: Help; Support

* |medkit| **Help** - **Use this button if you have any questions about CoCalc.** If you have a question while you have a file open in CoCalc, clicking **Help** will automatically include a link to the file in your request, allowing our support team to understand the issue better. If you are getting a result that you don't expect, it helps to include steps for us to reproduce the problem.

.. index:: Project Toolbar; account tab

* **Account** - Click here to update your profile, sign out, order subscriptions, view your upgrades, `add SSH Keys <http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2017/09/08/using-ssh-with-cocalc.html>`_, and check on support tickets. Read more about account operations :doc:`here <account>`.

.. index:: Project Toolbar; notification (bell) icon

* |bell| **Notifications** - A count is displayed over the bell if there are chat updates or file edits in projects you own or collaborate on. Click the bell to view a list of pending notifications, showing which account originated them and a link to the project or file being updated at the time.

.. index:: Connection Status

* |wifi| **Connection Status**. The connection status icon changes color as shown below to indicate changes in the connection between your browser and CoCalc servers.

  .. figure:: img/getting-started/conn-stat.png
    :width: 35%
    
    ..


  Clicking the connection status icon brings up a window with additional connection detail as shown below, including round-trip ping time to the CoCalc servers. If the ping time doesn't appear right away, wait a bit; it's tested every 30 seconds when the window is open.

.. index:: Project Toolbar; fullscreen mode

* |expand| **Fullscreen Mode** - Clicking here will toggle fullscreen mode, in which the project and file toolbars are shown or hidden.

.. index:: Files Toolbar
.. index:: Toolbars; files
.. _files-toolbar:

The Files Toolbar
-----------------

The **Files Toolbar** is next, appears below the Project Toolbar when you have a project open.
Use it to work with files in the currently open project.
When you open a file, its name appears in the Files Toolbar.
When you select a file in the toolbar, its contents are displayed in the browser.

.. image:: img/getting-started/toolbars-files-a.png
     :width: 90%

From left to right:

.. _ft-files:

* |folder-open| **Files** - If you don't have a file open, clicking here will show you a list of files
  in the project's home directory. If you are working on a file, clicking **Files** will show a list of
  files in the directory containing the currently selected file. You can enter search characters to
  filter the file list for filenames containing the search text.

.. _ft-new:

* |plus-circle| **New** - click to create or upload new files. **New** also lets you
  browse the `CoCalc Library <http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2018/03/06/cocalc-library.html>`_, which contains code examples and entire books about various toolsets
  and science topics, ready to copy into your project.

.. _ft-history:

* |history| **Log** - The **Project Activity Log** shows recent activity in your project:
  logins, files opened and uploaded, etc. If you click on a filename in the log, it will open
  that file. This is often the quickest way to resume work on a file that was recently closed.

.. _ft-search:

* |search| **Find** - Search  for files containing the specified text in the directory that contains
  the currently selected file, or the project home directory if no file is selected. There are options
  to for searching subdirectories, case sensitive search, including hidden files, and restricting search
  to files in a git repository.

.. _ft-info:

* |settings| **Info** - This panel offers a consolidated view of real-time activity within the current project. Use the Help toggle above the Memory column for details about this extremely useful panel. You can view use of CPU, memory, and disk space. There is a list of running processes, showing resource use by each and allowing you to terminate non-essential processes.

.. note::

    The "Memory" column in the Info panel's process list can help you track down out-of-memory problems.

.. image:: img/getting-started/process-info.png
     :align: center
     :width: 95%

.. _ft-settings:

* |wrench| **Settings** - This tab is where you can set a description for your project, add or remove
  upgrades, hide or delete the project, add a project-specific `SSH Key <http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2017/09/08/using-ssh-with-cocalc.html>`_, view and add collaborators, stop and restart the project and the Sage worksheet server,
  and launch the Plain Jupyter and JupyterLab servers.
  *Hint: Adding hashtags to the description can make it easy to find a subject with the Project button if you have a large number of projects.*

.. _ft-open-files:

* **Open Files** - a button will appear for each file you have open. There are several ways to open a file in CoCalc:

  * Select the name of the file in :doc:`../project-files` list.

  * Select the filename in an entry in the :ref:`Project Activity Log <ft-history>`.

  * Use the `open` command to open the file :ref:`from a terminal <terminal-file-open>`.


.. _ft-share:

* |share-square| **Share** - If a file is selected, this button allows you to share it. Files shared publicly
  can be viewed by people without a CoCalc login.

.. _ft-comment:

* |comment| **Chat** - If a file is selected, you can click here to start text or video chat.
  Collaborators on the project will get a notification when chat is opened or updated.

Your CoCalc Session
-------------------

.. index:: Member Hosting;compute session

CoCalc will keep track of projects you have open and files that are open within those projects.
When you return, you will see the same open projects and files.
In addition, if you have a program running and disconnect, it will keep running, with a few
exceptions: the program will stop if any of the following occurs:

* your project is on a trial server (i.e. does not have Member Hosting upgrade applied) and the server is restarted

* you do not edit a file for more than the idle time specified in **Project Settings**

* the program crashes or runs out of memory
