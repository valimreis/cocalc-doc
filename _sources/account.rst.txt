Account
===========================

Your "account" on CoCalc is everything related to your current identity.
Your identity gives you access to your :doc:`Projects <project>`, where you can either be an owner or collaborator.
The :ref:`account-settings` allow you to customize many aspects of how the user interface behaves.
It also contains the configuration for setting up
:doc:`subscriptions/purchasing course packages <upgrade-guide>` and
an overview about how your upgrades are currently distributed.
