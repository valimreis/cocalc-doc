----------------------

* Platform

  * **multifile latex** initial release
     * The user interface is initially identical to the current single-file interface, except with some bug fixes.
     * If you explicitly input other files, then build, there is a new menu on the top of a text editor that lets you select from any of the subfiles.
     * If you double click on the pdf on some latex generated by a subfile, then that file is automatically opened.
     * Errors and warnings have links that, when clicked, may open a subfile.
     * Forward search from subfiles works as it should.
     * Saving a subfile saves all files and kicks off a build.
  * upgrade to the latest version of `pdfjs <https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/>`_
  * bug fix: latex hyperref link boxes in pdf preview - this was CoCalc `issue 3750 <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3750>`_
  * bug fix: edge case where clicking wouldn't quite scroll the right part of the document into view

This note includes updates made to the platform over the past few weeks.

* Platform

  * Publicly sharing files isn't disabled.
  * There is a share server to serve the files.
  * The idle timeout fully works.
  * In project settings, you'll now only see the idle timeout quota and nothing else (which makes sense as all other quotas are meaningless there).
  * As admin, you can edit the idle timeout to be whatever you want for any particular project.
  * As admin, you can browse projects of your users through the admin page.

* Software

  * Julia updated to version 1.2.0

* Sagemath

  * updated to version 8.9
