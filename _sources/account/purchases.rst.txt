=========================

This section lists your currently active license subscriptions, personal plans, and course packages.
The word "Active" denotes ordinary active subscriptions.
The word "Trialing" indicates a free trial or other custom subscription plan.

.. note::

    If you have further questions about course packages, subscriptions, or upgrades,
    please consult the :ref:`upgrades-faq`!

Note that you can "stack" multiple course plans to combine the resources. In the example above, a Small Course (25 students) and a Medium Course (70 students) are combined to provide for a class of 95 students.

.. index:: Account Tab; cancel subscription
.. index:: Cancel subscription

Personal subscriptions renew automatically. Course plans do *not* renew automatically.

**To cancel a subscription**, find the subscription in the active subscription list and click ``End`` at the far right.
The subscription will not be auto-renewed at the next renewal date and the expiration date will be displayed in the subscription list.
