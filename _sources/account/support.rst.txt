View your open and closed CoCalc support requests here. A red background indicates an open ticket, while a blue background indicates a closed ticket.

.. note::

    If you email CoCalc support from an email address other than what is  on your account, the help ticket that is created won't be listed here. *A good rule when you have a question is to have the file relating to your question open in CoCalc, then click the Help button to request support. That way, the ticket will be listed here, and CoCalc staff will see a link to the file in question.*
